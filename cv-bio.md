I am a New Media Artist and Technologist with a keen interest in game design and production.

I graduated from Novosibirsk State Technical University with a degree in Design and Technology of Radio Electronics.

From 1999 to 2004, I worked as a Junior Researcher at the Newest Media Department of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography. During this time, I was designing and programming GIS and 3D-scanning applications for archaeologists.

In 2005, I worked as an artist assistant at the first Moscow biennale of contemporary art, where I assisted with film production for Clemens von Wedemeyer.

In 2006, I was in the artist residence Blumen in Leipzig, where I worked as a feature film director and video editor. Later, I worked as an artist and video editor in Moscow, but in late 2009, I returned to Novosibirsk.

Back in Siberia, I experimented with video production, but later returned to hardware engineering and programming for art installations. I also gained expertise in 3D-printing and 3D-scanning/photogrammetry.

During this time, I started organizing exhibitions and open-culture activities, including:
Series of workshops “Art & Technology” (2011-2016)
A self-organized artists’ space and studios “Studio 109” (2012-2018)
Monthly exhibitions “Grishchenko’s Garage” (2016-2019)
Regular game-jam which later became “Siberian Game Jam” (2017)

From 2018 to 2020, I worked as an R&D Datascientist at Motiv-NT, a company providing industrial solutions based on Neural Networks, Computer Vision, and Data Science. My job was to develop a pipeline for generating synthetic data for consistent neural networks based production quality control.

Since 2021, I have been working as a freelance artist and technology consultant. My current interests revolve around working with 3D-data (photogrammetry, point clouds, 3DGS) and game development and production.
