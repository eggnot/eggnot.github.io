Online radio for sonified matter.
It was done during the Science-art festival 2014. Alexey Kirutin is working with Nuclear Spectrometer. He explained how matter is sampled with nuclear spectrography to reveal relations of atoms in 3d. As data from apparatus is used only in spectral form, I was curious about its amplitude.
Considering this, we decided to make an internet radio revealing current experiments in scientific institutes. With a link above one can listen to popular matter sampled on Nuclear Spectrometer.
